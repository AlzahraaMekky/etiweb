            <p class="p text-justify">Management is the administration of an organisation, whether it be a business, a not-forprofit
               organisation, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organisation and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to
               accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial,
               natural, technological, and human resources. In keeping with other organisational
               functions, those who manage procurement and supply activity must possess expertise in
               developing and fulfilling organisational and functional objectives. It is therefore, essential
               that learners gain a wider appreciation of theories and techniques that relate to managing
               teams and individuals involved with the procurement and supply function.

            <p class="p text-justify">Risk management is a central part of an organisation’s strategy. It is a process whereby the organisation will identify, record and then address the risks associated with their activities with the aim of driving out or controlling those risks to the overall benefit of organisational
               efficiency and effectiveness. The supply chain is by its very nature a complex activity which
               is therefore susceptible to risk and its associated impacts. This module is designed to enable
               learners to examine the nature of supply chain risk and to evaluate mitigation techniques
               which are available to them as they deal with the associated challenges. They will undertake
               risk analysis and consider the advantages of a risk register as they apply a range of
               appropriate risk management tools and techniques to the supply chain.
